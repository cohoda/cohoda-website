                        <p>Gardening Express are a large online retailer of plants and gardening equipment.</p>

                        <p>They came to us to refresh their aging, classic asp based website, that wasn't mobile friendly. We delivered them a fully responsive magento based solution, developed as a future proof platform for growth.</p>

                        <p>To cater for customers on all platforms and devices, we put together a mobile friendly responsive site. We also employ the latest caching and magnification techniques to minimise bandwidth and page load times.</p>

                        <p>To offer customers a seamless transition, we wrote custom scripts to import almost a million historical records into the new Magento platform. This meant their customers didn't need to re-register to use the new site. They could also view their past orders.</p>
